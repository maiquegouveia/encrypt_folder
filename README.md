# encrypt_folder
Encrypts folder using Fernet key
To run this program you're gonna need to install cryptography package, to install run 'pip install cryptography' in the command prompt (cmd)
You need to have a Fernet key already, if you don't have one, you can find a program to generate the key in my repositories.
